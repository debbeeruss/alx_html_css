In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer. 

Requirements
you are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
you are not to use Javascript
